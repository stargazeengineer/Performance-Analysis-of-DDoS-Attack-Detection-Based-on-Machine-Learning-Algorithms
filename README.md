# Performance Analysis of DDoS Attack Detection Based on Machine Learning Algorithms

In recent years, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have become a major challenge in the field of cybersecurity. This study aims to analyze various machine learning algorithms and identify the most effective method for improving the accuracy of DDoS attack detection. I selected five classic machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes, and conducted experiments using the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset.

The results show that Random Forest, SVM, and KNN performed the best, with both accuracy and F1-score exceeding 99.74%. Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 97.82%, though it still had a small number of misclassifications. Due to its assumption of feature independence, Naive Bayes performed poorly when handling network traffic data. I also used ROC curves and AUC values to evaluate the performance of each model.

This study analyzes the applicability, advantages, and disadvantages of different machine learning algorithms in DDoS attack detection, providing a useful reference for practical applications. The project code includes the complete data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation process, allowing researchers to easily reproduce the experimental results. Detailed explanations for each step are also included in the code.
